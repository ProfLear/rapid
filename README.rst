RAPID
=====

Simulate IR and Raman peaks with fast exchange

Install/Packaging
-----------------

You can install `rapid` via `pip`, and it will automatically be
added to your command-line path. 

If you are packaging for another user, install `pyinstaller`, and
run `pyinstaller rapid.spec`.  This will create an app bundle or
exe (for Mac or Windows respectively) that can be distributed
to other users.
